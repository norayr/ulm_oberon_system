All releases since 0.7 for the Intel platform have to survive a steady
state test before we put them onto our FTP server. Usually, we run the
steady state test on a SuSE Linux system (currently 9.1), a Red Hat
Enterprise release and sometimes on Debian installations. Other Linux
variants are not easily accessible for us.

In a steady state test, a system consisting of a compiler and its
libraries compiles itself from scratch. Afterwards the generated results
are compared with those of the original system. In case of identity,
we have a steady state.

However, binaries are not guaranteed to be identical even if they are
equivalent. Currently, identical results are only to be obtained if
you start from an empty database that is just filled with all sources
required. The order in which modules are compiled influences in some cases
initialization sequences. This is harmless but generates non-identical
results.

Following sequence allows to perform a steady-state test:

(1) Start immediately after the instructions of INSTALL. Do not
    attempt to compile anything before running this test. Otherwise
    you have to shut down cdbd, remove its database, start it again
    and load the sources using load_libsources.

(2) Run

       make DestDir=$OBERON steadystatetest

    This takes less than ten minutes on a moderately fast machine
    with a sufficient amount of physical memory (2.4Ghz, > 1GB main
    memory).
    
Note that the entire system is compiled _twice_ in this test. This is
necessary as the shipped distribution was not generated from scratch
starting with an empty database but cross-compiled on our SPARC-based
development system.

Temporary directories stage1 and stage2 are generated in the current
directory (top-level directory of the unarchived release). You can
remove them safely if the steady state test was successful. In case
of failures, the tof files should be compared against each other.
Please report failures to us.
