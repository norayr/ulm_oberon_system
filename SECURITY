Program texts and generated code will be downloaded through pons
and cdbd. Hence there is a security concern that the name space
provided by pons and the database serviced by cdbd shall be
safe against attacks.

The services provided by pons and cdbd are by default available on
the local host only. The default configuration uses following ports:

   9880   pons: boot service (see NamesBootService)
   9881   pons: port of RemoteObjects
   9882   cdbd: port of RemoteObjects

(The ports 9883, 9884, and 9885 are similarly used by the steady
state test).

It is possible to change the binding addresses by using following
make parameters:

   parameter | default value
   ----------+----------------
   ONSRoot   | 127.0.0.1:9880
   ONSPort   | 127.0.0.1:9881
   CDBDPort  | 127.0.0.1:9882
      
Example: To open the services for other hosts, you could pass
following parameters to make:

   make ONSRoot=0:9880 ONSPort=0:9881 CDBDPort=0:9882

``0'' supports all available IPv4 addresses on the local host.
You are also free to name an IP address or a domain name where
IPv4 TCP sockets can be bound to.

There is currently no support to restrict connections. You need
to configure your firewall to achieve this.

If a pons service is to be shared among a set of local hosts,
this can most easily be setup by adding a TXT record for the
local domain that points to the boot service of pons. Example:

   mathematik.uni-ulm.de. IN TXT "ons=thales.mathematik.uni-ulm.de:9880"

Alternatively, the environment variable ONS_ROOT can be used.

By default, pons grants read access to all but requires authorization
for write accesses and shutdowns. Authorization keys are stored within
the files ``write'' and ``shutdown'' in the var/pons directory.

Likewise, cdbd grants by default read access only. Write accesses
and shutdowns require the authorization key out of the ``write''
file of the var/cdbd directory. Most commands support the environment
parameter CDB_AUTH that allows to specify the path to a file
containing the authorization key for cdbd. You need to make this
file available to all hosts in a networked environment where one
database is to be shared among all.

None of these services require root privileges. Hence it is not
recommended to run them with root privileges.
